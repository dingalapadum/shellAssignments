diff customer_file our_file

1. The customer has edited his file and he thinks he has lost some entries we provided, please help him:
- please provide him with a list of all the strings that apear in our_file and do not apear in his:
-- start with a diff and note

2. He forgot to tell you, that he not only keeps track of the entries we provide but also of the entries provided by the CIA


2. He then realizes, that it is not enough for him to know which strings are missing, but also how many times each of the entries apears in our file
