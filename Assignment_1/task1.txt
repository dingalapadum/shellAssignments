- The customer downloads packages from our servers
- For some apps we recommend that he should have multiple insances running to have some fault tolerance
- We have a file our_file where we have the configuration that we recommend to him
- Unfortunately someone deleted some instances in the prod and now they don't know what they should download
- The file customer_file reflects his current state

Note: The files have the same order - the only difference is in that the customer_file is missing entries:
- verfiy this using vimdiff

- Please help the customer:

1. provide him with a list of components he has to download again from the Custzone



2. He then realizes that this alone is not enough: he also needs to know how many instances he should have running of these components. Provide him with a list of the instances he has to setup. The file should adhere to the follwing conditions:
-- have the components name sorted alphabetically and have the format:
 	
	componentName: <number of instances to install>

-- if there is nothing to do about a component, then the customer doesn't want to have an entry in this file (i.e. if he has all the instances he requires for a specific component up and running)



3. he suddenly isn't sure, what the right amount of components is he should have running. Of course he could infer it using the customer_file together with the stuff you already provided... but hey, he is paying you so he treats you like his *female dog* because otherwise he'll go to Abraxas. We don't want to lose this valuable customer who like so much working with. Please provide him the list he wants:

 	componentName: <number of total instances>, <number of instances he has running>, <number of instances to install>



4. he then realizes that he needs to hand this file to the infrastructure team and they don't get it what those numbers mean. Of course he could just add a column-headers, but hey, he is paying you so blablabla... JUST DO IT! Ah, and since you need to work on the file anyway, please capitalize the first letter of every component

	ComponentName: total <number of total instances>, currently running <number of instances he has running>, to install <number of instances to install>



5. OMFG, the PITA wrote another mail :( . For some funny reason he wants the file to be sorted by the number of instances he has to install. Please sort the file by the last column.
