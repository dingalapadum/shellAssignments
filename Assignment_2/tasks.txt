- The customer downloads packages from our servers

- For some apps we recommend that he should have multiple insances running to have some fault tolerance

- We have a file our_file where we have the configuration that we recommend to him:
-- The file is very simple: every line is the name of an app-instance. 
-- If we recommend having multiple instances of an app, we simply have the line appearing that number of times in the file: 2 instances, then the app name appears 2

- Unfortunately someone deleted some instances in the prod and now they don't know what they should download

- The file customer_file reflects his current state

Note: The files have the same order - the only difference is in that the customer_file is missing entries:
- verfiy this using vimdiff

- Please help the customer:


1. He would like to have our_file. Unfortunately he doesn't like the format we use but he rather wants the following:
-- have the components name sorted alphabetically and have the format:
 	
<number of instances to install> componentName

-- put that in result1.txt.


2. he suddenly realizes that it is too complicated to go through the customer file and check how many instances he has running and figure out what to install. Please provide him with a list of the installations he has to do. Same format as result2.txt but now only with the number of installations he has to do for each of the apps (result3.txt)

2. provide him with a list of components he has to download again from the Custzone: note that he does not need to download the same app multiple times in order to have mutiple insances running: having each app once is enough. Please sort the apps lexicographically and put that list in result1.txt


4. he then realizes that he needs to hand this file to the infrastructure team and they don't get it what those numbers mean. Of course he could just add a column-headers, but hey, he is paying you so blablabla... JUST DO IT! Ah, and since you need to work on the file anyway, please capitalize the first letter of every component

ComponentName: total <number of total instances>, currently running <number of instances he has running>, to install <number of instances to install>



5. OMFG, the PITA wrote another mail :( . For some funny reason he wants the file to be sorted by the number of instances he has to install. Please sort the file by the last column.
